Sample springboot crud application

## How to use

Given that docker is installed to your machine
- Go to the root folder of the project and run start.sh
- wait for the gradle build and test to finished and docker images to be downloaded
- then go to http://localhost:8086/swagger-ui.html to test the app through swagger

Happy testing :)
